      "message": "Is this about not having to hard-code the package name? I think for Calyx it would be totally fine to hard-code it, however, I am aware of people on other ROMs enjoying GCamPreview as well. For those it would stop working. The not-hardcoding is supposed to help with this use-case. So I am not sure how another module in Glimpse would help, can you explain?",

      "message": "It was more about not depending upon glimpse. Currently the app is standalone and would work for the foreseeable future. Glimpse already has a module for lens launcher related work. Why not a new module in it for handling the requirement for google photos in there too if Glimpse will be doing the heavy lifting in the end? All code is in one repo that way.",
