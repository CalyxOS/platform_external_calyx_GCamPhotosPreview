      "message": "It\u0027s looking like using ClipData for secondary media items is nothing more than aspirational, since none of the gallery apps I\u0027ve tried support it:\n- Google Photos\n- Google Gallery\n- Simple Gallery (no support for android.provider.action.REVIEW_SECURE)\n- Aves / Aves Libre (no support for android.provider.action.REVIEW_SECURE)\n- Gallery, built-in (no support for android.provider.action.REVIEW_SECURE)\n- Other various top results for Gallery from Aurora Store\n\nAdhering to specifications is nice, but apparently nothing does, so the ClipData support doesn\u0027t seem useful right now.",
